# Backend - Post-Process

This component is responsible for:

- read output files generated by *backend-postprocess*,
- retrieve data from third-party sources,
- maintain a historical archive of imported data,
- generate data for visualization, and
- submit the outputs to the *frontend*.

It was originally designed to be hosted on UIowa - IIHR server such as *S-IIHR 54*.

## Setting up the environment

### Git sparse checkout

Suppose you will host your application on `[SYS-ROOT]/` directory for development.

Create the empty directory, move to there and initiate a git repository there:

    $ mkdir [SYS-ROOT]/
    $ cd [SYS-ROOT]/
    $ git init

Add the IHMIS GitHub repository as the *origin* remote Git repository:


    $ git remote add -f origin https://github.com/.../IHMIS.git


Activate sparse checkout and limit the versioned content to the *backend-modelrun* directory:


    $ git config core.sparseCheckout true
    $ echo 'backend-postprocess/' > .git/info/sparse-checkout


Pull the code from the origin repository, *develop* branch:

    git pull origin develop


### Setting up configuration files

Copy all the content from the `conf-TEMPLATE/` folder to the `conf/` directory.

Go over each file in the `conf/` directory tree structure, adapting their content to your system's particularities. 

After each file is changed, rename the file by removing the `-TEMPLATE` prefix (example: `filesys-TEMPLATE.json` -> `filesys.json`).
